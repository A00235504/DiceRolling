# DiceRolling

Basic Dice Rolling App.

About This is a simple dice rolling Application where a user can roll dice infinite amount of times. The App has got three options to roll a dice.
1. Single or simple one dice
2. Double dice or two dice option
3. Custom single dice with user input sides less than 100

For the single and double sides dice the user can have the ability to change the number of sides by selecting the drop down list.

The drop down list has pre defined values and also the user can add values by the custom sides dice option. Each time the user will roll the custom sides dice the number of sides drop down list will be added with the custom dice entered in the text field.

The list can be restored to defaults also by clicking the "Restore list to defaults".

The app has this cool feature of adding the dice roll history and saving in the phone memory. Also the textfield entered is saved in the memory. So next time you come and see the app the last entered value will always be there.

There are also error resolving techniques used to reduce the app crash.
